# Smilegate interview test

## Preview demo

Because the project is built on vue-cli, the product will render client side, so to see the demo test, please run the `yarn serve` command to test the router (indie game,entry game, community).

## Explain about project

Build with: Vue-cli, vue 2, typescript, vue-router, SCSS. However, there will be a lot of things that are not good, I hope if I can continue to participate in the technical interview, I will have the opportunity to present and answer your any questions about this project.

  - For example: some components have not been optimized for reuse by me (button, product list...).

Through the information about the company described, I am so excited to stand the opportunity to be part of your amazing team and i can contribute my energy to your development journey!

Thank you! Wishing you all a wonderful day!
